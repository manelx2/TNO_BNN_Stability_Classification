# TNO_BNN_Stability_Classification
Bayesian Neural Networks are used to predict the long-term stability of Trans-Neptunian Objects from REBOUND N-body simulations. Framed as a probabilistic binary classification task, the model compares MC Dropout and Bayes by Backpropagation and provides uncertainty-aware stability predictions to efficiently screen dynamical candidates.
